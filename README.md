# Personal Dashboard

## Overview

A personal dashboard designed to provide quick access to weather data, cryptocurrency prices, currency exchange rates, news, and a simple todo list - all in one place.
The project was created both for practical daily use and as a way to improve my skills in React, using TypeScript.

## 📌 Features

### Weather Board

 - Displays current weather conditions in chosen city
 - Powered by OpenWeatherMap API

### Crypto Board

 - Shows real-time cryptocurrency prices (btc, eth, bnb, ton, doge)
 - Powered by CoinGecko API

### Currency Board

 - Displays exchange rates for 100 USD in different currencies
 - Powered by fawazahmed0/exchange-api

### News Board

 - Fetches news based on user-defined keywords
 - Uses NewsAPI (note: direct frontend requests are restricted, so this module is incomplete)

### Todo Board

 - Simple todo list
 - Stored in localStorage (no backend)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

 - React
 - TypeScript
 - No backend (fully client-side)

## 📱 Responsiveness

The current layout is optimized for desktop usage.
Mobile and tablet support is planned for future improvement.

## 🚧 Deployment Status

The project is <b>not deployed yet</b>.
Attempts were made using Vercel, but NewsAPI does not allow client-side requests from the browser, and the project was not designed with a backend layer.
A dedicated backend or serverless function would be required for full deployment.
